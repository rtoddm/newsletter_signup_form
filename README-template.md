### What I learned

This was a great project for me to learn and practice JS form validation! One of the things I learned during this project was how to use the Constraint Validation API for form or input validation. Another great improvement was my use of CSS custom properties.

### Continued development

As I continue I plan on focusing on developing my CSS and JS even further.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs was a great resource for me while working on this project. Specifically their information on JS form validation of CSS custom properties.
